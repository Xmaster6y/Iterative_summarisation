# Iterative summarization interpretability

Experiment on Iterative Summarization, potentially linked to Natural Abstraction. Made for the Alignment jam #4, see the [write-up](./jam4_write-up.pdf) for more details.

## Related work and sources

* This notebook humbly tries to explore the notion of [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction) through iterative summarization. This Interpretability work could be a start on grasping the surface of Natural Abstraction experiments. It can be related to a series of post by [johnswentworth](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/johnswentworth) (notably ["Project Intro"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cy3BhHrGinZCp3LXE/testing-the-natural-abstraction-hypothesis-project-intro), ["The Telephone Theorem"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jJf4FrfiQdDGg7uco/the-telephone-theorem-information-at-a-distance-is-mediated), ["Project Update"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dNzhdiFE398KcGDc9/testing-the-natural-abstraction-hypothesis-project-update) and ["Abstractions as Redundant Information"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vvEebH5jEvxnJEvBC/abstractions-as-redundant-information)).

* The code is inspired by Neel Nanda's [demo notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/main/Main_Demo.ipynb), his library [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) and is supported by the [Amazon](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html) (small) dataset of movie and TV reviews available [here](https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon_v2/categoryFilesSmall/Movies_and_TV_5.json.gz). The [TL;DR](https://aclanthology.org/W17-4508/) dataset of Reddit was formerly used but reviews were often not pleasant.

## Demo notebooks

The repository is accompanied by notebooks containing the cell's outputs, see below.

## Future work

The idea could be to emphasize the experiment on abstraction and iterative models, see the [write-up](./jam4_write-up.pdf) for references.
